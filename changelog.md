### Hey there, I really appreciate that you have wonderful project out Here

I have gone through the project and I have some suggestions for you. I hope you will like it.

###### Making the lib usability as easy as possible to the user
- [ ]  Current structure of the lib not organized well. 
    * Restructure the lib to make it more organized. 
    * ```bash
        ├── src
        │   ├── agents
        │   │   ├── vercelai
        │   │   │   ├── index.ts
        │   │   │   ├── createSolanaAgent
        │   │   ├── langchain
        │   │   │   ├── index.ts
        │   │   │   ├── createSolanaAgent
        │   │   ├── instructor
        │   │   │   ├── index.ts
        │   │   │   ├── createSolanaAgent
        │   ├── schemas (zod schemas)
        │   ├── tools
        │   ├── constants
        │   ├── utils
        ```
- [ ]  And Existing code for langchain agent is not very good. 
    * Refactor the code to make it more readable and maintainable.
    * ```typescript
        import { createSolanaAgent } from './agents/langchain';
        const agent = createSolanaAgent();
        ```
    * since the code is suppose to reture the compiled graph, it be easy to attach with any existing langchain / ai agent system
- [ ]  Adding zod schema for input and output since this will be easy for the using it to ensure the structural tools
